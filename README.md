## Comment about the api used in this project

Originally, the api used in this project was hosted in `https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/` however this site does not work anymore. If you want to keep the original functionality, clone the [original project](https://github.com/janaipakos/ghibliapi) , set it up using node 7 and `npm install && npm run start` and replace `https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/` for `http://localhost:3000`
